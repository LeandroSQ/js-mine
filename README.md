## Devlog

### Day 0

After playing a little bit with `WebGL 2.0` this is what I came up with:

<p align="center">
	<img src=".github/screenshots/day0.gif" style="height: 400px; border-radius: 10pt; box-shadow: 0px 5pt 15pt rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)"/>
</p>

<p align="center">Some really cool looking cube, <br>where each pixel is being colored by their normal.</p>

I think I spent more time coming up with the `GIF` above than actually coding it. Since I wanted something nice and `screen recording` + `gif conversion` + `free online editors` were not cutting it, I decided to save the frames, zip them, download and run `ffmpeg` to convert them to a gif.
