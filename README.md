## Devlog

### Day 0

After playing a little bit with `WebGL 2.0` this is what I came up with:

<p align="center">
	<img loading="lazy" src=".github/screenshots/day0.gif" style="height: 400px; border-radius: 10pt; box-shadow: 0px 5pt 15pt rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)"/>
</p>

<p align="center">Some really cool looking cube, <br>where each face is being colored by their normal.</p>

I think I spent more time coming up with the `GIF` above than actually coding the renderer. Since I wanted something nice and `screen recording` + `gif conversion` + `free online editors` were not cutting it... so I decided to save the frames, zip them, download and run `ffmpeg` to convert them to a gif.

Not long after that I introduced textures and a simple lighting system:
<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">Now we talking</p>

### Day 1

Did not have much time today, so mainly cleaned up the code, added wrappers for `WebGL` boilerplate which made life easier and also played with some post-processing effects.

Added `FXAA`, but it either introduces too much blur on the textures or does not work at all, not sure if this is apparent on the `GIF` below.

</p>
<p align="center"><small>Some FXAA artifacts</small></p>

Added some `sharpen`, `brightness`, `contrast` and `saturation`, which works great.

</p>

<p align="center">Original on the <b>left</b> and new on the <b>right</b>.<br><small>GIF above is compressed, colors may not be the same</small></p>

But mostly important, the rendering pipeline now supports frame buffers and drawing to textures with multi-pass filtering, all done with my wrappers which makes me happy.

### Day 2

The boilerplate is gone!
Spent the day refactoring the code, which makes creating meshes, shaders and buffers a breeze.
Also, why not, I moved the recording logic to a worker, first time I used an `OffscreenCanvas`... they are really powerful. Maybe I will use it for the rendering pipeline in the future, imagine the possibilities â€” rendering everything in a worker, no hiccups on the main thread.

</p>

<p align="center"><small>Some smooth <s>not really</s> camera controls</small><br>*This GIF is heavily compressed</p>

Also, since the mesh system is organized, creating a bunch of cubes is easy, I'm not using instanced rendering yet, and to be honest I won't, since the goal of the project is to generate a single mesh for the world, and not a mesh for each block. Nevertheless, this helps to visualize the goal.
