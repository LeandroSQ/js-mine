## Devlog

### Day 0

After playing a little bit with `WebGL 2.0` this is what I came up with:

<p align="center">
	<img loading="lazy" src=".github/screenshots/day0.gif" style="height: 400px; border-radius: 10pt; box-shadow: 0px 5pt 15pt rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)"/>
</p>

<p align="center">Some really cool looking cube, <br>where each face is being colored by their normal.</p>

I think I spent more time coming up with the `GIF` above than actually coding the renderer. Since I wanted something nice and `screen recording` + `gif conversion` + `free online editors` were not cutting it... so I decided to save the frames, zip them, download and run `ffmpeg` to convert them to a gif.

Not long after that I introduced textures and a simple lighting system:

</p>

<p align="center">Now we talking</p>

### Day 1

Did not have much time today, so mainly cleaned up the code, added wrappers for `WebGL` boilerplate which made life easier and also played with some post-processing effects.

Added `FXAA`, but it either introduces too much blur on the textures or does not work at all, not sure if this is apparent on the `GIF` below.

</p>
<p align="center"><small>Some FXAA artifacts</small></p>

Added some `sharpen`, `brightness`, `contrast` and `saturation`, which works great.

</p>

<p align="center">Original on the <b>left</b> and new on the <b>right</b>.<br><small>GIF above is compressed, colors may not be the same</small></p>

But mostly important, the rendering pipeline now supports frame buffers and drawing to textures with multi-pass filtering, all done with my wrappers which makes me happy.

### Day 2

The boilerplate is gone!
Spent the day refactoring the code, which makes creating meshes, shaders and buffers a breeze.
Also, why not, I moved the recording logic to a worker, first time I used an `OffscreenCanvas`... they are really powerful. Maybe I will use it for the rendering pipeline in the future, imagine the possibilities â€” rendering everything in a worker, no hiccups on the main thread.

<p align="center">
	<img loading="lazy" src=".github/screenshots/day2.gif" style="height: 400px; border-radius: 10pt; box-shadow: 0px 5pt 15pt rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)"/>
</p>

<p align="center"><small>Some smooth <s>not really</s> camera controls</small><br>*This GIF is heavily compressed</p>

Also, since the mesh system is organized, creating a bunch of cubes is easy, I'm not using instanced rendering yet, and to be honest I won't, since the goal of the project is to generate a single mesh for the world, and not a mesh for each block. Nevertheless, this helps to visualize the goal.

### Day 3

Actually didn't do much on the rendering side, I really wanted to work on my Gamepad support I carried over from other projects.
And now that the gamepad support was refined... I also thought it would be a nice addition having a virtual Gamepad overlay

<p align="center">
	<img loading="lazy" src=".github/screenshots/day3.gif" style="height: 120px; border-radius: 10pt; box-shadow: 0px 5pt 15pt rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)"/>
</p>

<p align="center"><small>Took more time than I'd like to admit, but it looks so sick</small></p>

Just so I can say I did something on the renderer, I created a `MeshBuilder`, the goal with this is to create geometry on the fly, so instead of rendering N cubes, I generate a single mesh with all the faces that are touching Air, which means the faces inside will be culled, and the faces outside will be rendered. **This is what makes this whole thing possible, without this optimization, the performance would be terrible.**

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center"><small>Note to self: I need to add a counter for triangles, vertices and draw calls<br>That would be a nice debugging info to have.</small></p>

### Day 4

A few things I added:
- **Chunk system**: I'm now rendering only the chunks that are visible, this is a huge performance boost, since I'm not rendering the whole world, only the parts that are visible.
- **Frustum culling**: I'm now only rendering the chunks that are inside the camera frustum, this was such a pain to implement, but it was worth it.
- **Terrain generation**: Using `simplex-noise.js`, I'm generating biomes and terrain, yet to be refined, but it's a start.
- **3D Gizmo system**: I'm now able to visualize objects when debugging, this is a huge help when working with `frustum culling`.
- **Ansiotropic filtering**: I'm now using `ansio filtering` for the textures, this makes the textures look better when viewed from a distance.
- **Multi camera support**: I'm now able to render to multiple cameras, I'm using this for debugging, I call it `the debug camera`.
- **Triangle, active chunks and vertices counter**: I was right, looks nice.
- **Rendering pipeline**: Automatically handling all my post-processing filters with double buffering, this is a huge help when adding new filters.

With all that, I can get a scene with 1024 chunks active (200~ rendered) at 100+fps on my M1 Macbook, which is pretty good. To show case all these features, instead of a thousand GIFs, I made a video:

	</a>
</p>

### Day 5


You also won't believe this, but I have made the terrain generation to be `M-U-L-T-I-T-H-R-E-A-D-E-D`, yes, you heard it right, I'm generating the terrain in a `worker`, this is a huge performance boost, since I'm not blocking the main thread with the generation of the terrain. Such a pain to handle the communication back-and-forth between the `worker` and the main thread, but it was worth it.

Another thing I implemented was a nice `debug console`, that just evaluates whatever JS code I input in it, this is a huge help when debugging, since I can test settings on the fly.

<p align="center">
	<img loading="lazy" src=".github/screenshots/day5-1.gif" style="height: 400px; border-radius: 10pt; box-shadow: 0px 5pt 15pt rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)"/>
</p>

<p align="center"><small>Pretty fancy, right?</small></p>


### Day 6

Since we now have terrain generation happening on the background I have split the process into two steps:
- **Generate the terrain**: This is done in a worker, generating the terrain and sending it back to the main thread.
- **Build the mesh**: This is done by the same worker, but using the main thread to orchestrate the process, since a chunk with updated meshing data will require its neighbors to be updated as well.

    </p>

<p align="center"><small>On the left with occluding faces hidden / right showing all faces neighboring chunks</small></p>

A 44% improvement on the amount of vertices/triangles being drawn! That's almost half of the mesh data that we don't have to send anymore to the GPU. A huge performance boost.
